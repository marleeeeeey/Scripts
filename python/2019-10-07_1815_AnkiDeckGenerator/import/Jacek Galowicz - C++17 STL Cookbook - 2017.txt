Table of Contents
Preface
Chapter 1: The New C++17 Features
Introduction Using structured bindings to unpack bundled return values How to do it...
decompress
restore something reduced in volume to its full volume
Compressing and decompressing strings How to do it...
decimal
a number in a system based on ten
Because copying a value from a double variable to an int variable cuts its decimal part after the point, we have some loss.
concurrent
occurring or operating at the same time
Synchronizing concurrent std::cout use
frequency
the number of occurrences within a given time period
Implementing a word frequency counter with std::map How to do it...
potential
existing in possibility
Unfortunately, they will potentially ignore a lot of optimization potential while doing that.
characteristic
typical or distinctive
The size of the hash table can be manipulated by the user, and the hash function can also be chosen individually, which is important, because the performance versus space consumption characteristics depend on that. std::unordered_set and std::unordered_map have so much interface in common with their std::set and std::map pendants, that they can be used almost interchangeably.
matter
that which has mass and occupies space
It allows us to hide complex solutions behind simple high-level interfaces but, at the same time, to write low-level code where high performance and low overhead really matter.
sentinel
a person employed to keep watch for some anticipated event
Terminating iterations over ranges with iterator sentinels How to do it...
arbitrary
based on or subject to individual discretion or preference
This struct, sum, accepts an arbitrary number of parameters and adds them together using a fold expression (have a look at the fold expression recipe a little later in this chapter to get more details on fold expressions).
denote
have as a meaning
The first two denote beginning and end of the underlying range.
concatenation
the act of linking together as in a series or chain
Composing functions by concatenation How to do it...
legacy
a gift of personal property by will
Simplifying resource handling of legacy APIs with smart pointers How to do it...
unnecessary
not needed
Especially for libraries with only very short functions, this is unnecessarily uncomfortable.
distinguish
mark as different
Conventions In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information.
arbitrarily
in a random manner
It does this in a greedy manner, which means that it is not possible to match non-aggregate constructors (nonaggregate constructors are usual constructors in contrast to the ones that accept an initializer list). std::vector, for example, provides a specific non-aggregate constructor, which fills arbitrarily many items with the same value: std::vector v (N, value).
underlying
in the nature of something though not readily apparent
The first two denote beginning and end of the underlying range.
consecutive
one after the other
Removing consecutive whitespace between words How to do it...
leak
enter or escape as through a hole or crack or fissure
This is another example where we would have a useless shared_pointer variable leaking into the current scope, although it has a potentially useless state outside the if conditional block or noisy extra brackets!
inherit
receive from a predecessor
Creating custom string classes by inheriting from std::char_traits How to do it...
obvious
easily perceived by the senses or grasped by the mind
The obvious idea is that the sum of nothing is 0.
spare
more than is needed, desired, or required
Then we declare that we are using namespace std to spare us some typing. using namespace std;
stock
a supply of something available for future use
Structured bindings also work with std::tuple: Let's take the following example function, which gets us online stock information: std::tuple std::chrono::system_clock::time_point, unsigned> stock_info(const std::string &name);
clamp
a device that holds things firmly together
Limiting the values of a vector to a specific numeric range with std:: clamp How to do it...
deduction
the act of removing a part from the whole
Using structured bindings to unpack bundled return values C++17 comes with a new feature, which combines syntactic sugar and automatic type deduction: structured bindings.
shuffle
walk by dragging one's feet
, rather than seeing one line of code, which uses a standard algorithm whose name clearly states what it does, such as accumulate, copy, move, transform, or shuffle.
sane
mentally healthy; free from mental disorder
Because we are handling not a numeric index, but an iterator this time, we need to check a bit differently if the iterator position is sane.
succeed
attain success or reach a desired goal
The first read succeeds in a strange way. repetitive
persistent
Calling multiple functions with the same
input There are a lot of tasks, which lead to repetitive code.
parenthesis
a punctuation mark used to enclose textual material
One nice detail about the {} operator compared to constructor calling using normal () parentheses is that they do no implicit type conversions: int x (1.2); and int x = 1.2; will initialize x to value 1 by silently rounding down the floating point value and converting it to int. int x {1.2};, in contrast, will not compile because it wants to exactly match the constructor type.
comma
a punctuation mark (,) indicating the separation of elements
Another operator that defaults to a certain expression when applied on empty parameter packs is the comma operator (,), which then defaults to void().
defining
the process of determining the form or meaning of something
When used for other data structures as vectors or lists, that second parameter is crucial for defining where the insert iterator shall insert new items.
contiguous
having a common boundary or edge
Contiguous storage The simplest way to store objects is to put them just next to each other in one large chunk of memory.
fraction
a small part or item forming a piece of a whole
Then, we can have a look at multiple examples that show how we can do it in C++17: Accessing individual values of an std::pair: Imagine we have a mathematical function, divide_remainder, which accepts a dividend and a divisor parameter and returns the fraction of both as well as the remainder.
emit
give off, send forth, or discharge
Other compilers would emit different but similar error messages.
trim
make a reduction in
Trimming whitespace from the beginning and end of strings How to do it...
failure
an act that does not succeed
Safely signalizing failure with std::optional How to do it...
acquire
come into the possession of something concrete or abstract
At runtime, the sanitizer libraries that are then linked into the program binary can, for example, replace the malloc and free functions in order to analyze how the program deals with the memory it acquires.
alias
a name that has been assumed temporarily
It contains the same using type alias clauses as other hash specializations. namespace std { template <> struct hash { using argument_type = coord; using result_type = size_t;
extremely
to the greatest possible degree
Chapter 3, Iterators, explains iterators, which are an extremely important abstraction as they
leaf
a flat, usually green part of a plant attached to a stem
That leaves the question, where will the end iterator point to if we do not know where the stream's end is?
slight
small in quantity or degree
We can also just encapsulate code to call it multiple times with slightly different parameters without having to implement a whole new function class for that task.
naive
marked by or showing unaffected simplicity
We could just naively use the insert or emplace methods of map and see if they succeed.
tidy
marked by order and cleanliness in appearance or habits
In this recipe, we use the initializer syntax in both the supported contexts in order to see how they tidy up our code: The if statements: Imagine we want to find a character in a character map using the find method of std::map: if (auto itr (character_map.find(c)); itr != character_map.end()) { // *itr is valid.
management
the act of controlling something
As of today, C++ is a language that provides language features and standard library facilities for sophisticated standard data structures and algorithms, automatic resource management pointers, lambda expressions, constant expressions, portable thread control for concurrent programming, regular expressions, random number generators, exceptions, variadic templates (the part of C++ for expressing template types is even...
nevertheless
despite anything to the contrary
Doing so and ignoring some of them is efficient, nevertheless, because the compiler can optimize the unused bindings out easily.
concept
an abstract or general idea inferred from specific instances
We are going to roll up the whole iterator concept from the ground to learn how to put them to the best use in all our programs.
determine
find out or learn with certainty, as by making an inquiry
Before C++17, a pair of extra braces was needed in order to determine the scope where it unlocks again.
observe
watch attentively
If it does not crash, we might observe that the program just behaves strangely from time to time, which could lead to even more headaches than a crashing program.
closure
termination of operations
Lambda expressions or lambda functions construct closures.
simulate
reproduce someone's behavior or looks
This way, we simulate the problem that we have to access specific functions that create and destroy instances of it: class Foo { string name; Foo(string n) : name{n} { cout << "CTOR " << name << '\n'; } ~Foo() { cout << "DTOR " << name << '\n';}
storage
the act of keeping something for future use
Introduction Contiguous storage List storage Search trees Hash tables Container adapters Using the erase-remove idiom on std::vector How to do it...
ownership
the state of being in possession of something
Thanks to C++11, we don't even need to copy strings when we want to transfer ownership to some other function or data structure anymore because we can move them.
tedious
so lacking in interest as to cause mental weariness
Unfortunately, they are sometimes a bit tedious to use, which is why many novices avoid them and fall back to C-Style C++.
quotation
a passage or expression that is cited
No part of this book may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system, or transmitted in any form or by any means, without the prior written permission of the publisher, except in the case of brief quotations embedded in critical articles or reviews.
preface
a short introductory essay preceding the text of a book
Preface The C++17 STL Cookbook will teach you how to get the most out of C++17 by providing coding recipes that combine the C++ language and its standard library, the STL.
needle
a sharp pointed implement
In this case, this is "elitr": int main() { const string long_string { "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur" " sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod"}; const string needle {"elitr"};
descend
move downward and lower, but not necessarily all the way
It works exactly like directory_iterator in the previous recipe, but it also descends down into subdirectories.
asynchronous
not occurring or existing at the same time
In this recipe, we are going to write a simple program that does multiple things at the same time using asynchronous function calls.
efficiently
in a manner that wastes no time or effort
Inserting items efficiently and conditionally into std::map How to do it...
transformed
given a completely different form or appearance
It calls the reduce function on this accumulator and the fn transformed input variable.
defer
yield to another's wish or opinion
The second constructor argument defer_lock tells the object to keep the lock unlocked.
expire
lose validity
The expired function of weak_ptr tells us if the object it points to still really exists, because holding a weak pointer to an object does not prolong its lifetime!
preceding
existing or coming before
Instead of doing it as shown in the preceding code snippet, we can now assign the individual values to individual variables with expressive names, which is much better to read: auto [fraction, remainder] = divide_remainder(16, 3); std::cout << "16 / 3 is " << fraction << " with a remainder of " << remainder << '\n';
revolve
turn on or around an axis or a center
The whole recipe revolves around the try_emplace function of std::map, which is a new C++17 addition.
rely
have confidence or faith in
All the recipes in this book are designed to be as near as possible to real-life problems, while at the same time, they do not rely on any external libraries other than the STL.
alter
cause to change; make different
Moreover, as std::move is an algorithm that also alters the data source, we will print the source vector too.
prompt
according to schedule or without delay
Let's add a little helper function that prints a line that prompts the user to enter some text: static void prompt() { cout << "Next input please:\n > "; }
especial
surpassing what is common or usual or expected
The if statements with initializers are especially useful when using legacy APIs with output parameters: if (DWORD exit_code; GetExitCodeProcess(process_handle, &exit_code)) { std::cout << "Exit code of process was: " << exit_code << '\n'; } // No useless exit_code variable outside the if-conditional
encapsulate
enclose in or as if in a small container
In order to read the whole file, we initialize an std::string from input stream iterators which encapsulate std::cin. int main() { cin.unsetf(ios::skipws); string content {istream_iterator{cin}, {}};
redundant
more than is needed, desired, or required
In some cases, this might be declared redundant, because the combination of items with themselves (like in (1, 1)) or redundant combinations of (1, 2) and (2, 1) may not be needed.
buggy
a small lightweight carriage
Therefore it's better to not define them because if an algorithm depends on those items being referenceable in memory, it might be buggy when combined with our iterator.
decompose
break down
The compiler immediately chokes on this and tells us about our mistake: error: type 'std::tuple' decomposes into 3 elements, but only 2 names were provided auto [a, b] = tup;
sharing
unselfishly willing to partake with others
Sharing different member values of the same object How to do it...
weird
strikingly odd or unusual
Pointer alignment: Some architectures cannot access memory if it has a weird alignment in memory.
simplicity
the quality of being uncomplicated
For the sake of simplicity, the new minimum is 0, so no matter what offset the old data had, its normalized values will always be relative to 0.
partial
being or affecting only a segment
In this section, we are going to play with std::sort and std:: partial_sort: 1.
shrink
wither, as with a loss of moisture
Note that this might lead the vector code to allocate a new chunk of memory that fits and moves all items from the old chunk to the new one. v. shrink_to_fit();
notion
a general inclusive concept
When using binary folds in order to implement the no-argument case, the notion of an identity element is often important--in this case, adding a 0 to any number changes nothing, which makes 0 an identity element.
strict
rigidly accurate; allowing no deviation from a standard
The algorithm will strictly preserve the order of all non-2 values while doing that.
satisfy
meet the requirements or expectations of
constexpr (optional) If we mark the lambda expression explicitly as constexpr, the compiler will error out if it does not satisfy the criteria of constexpr functions.
tamper
alter or falsify, usually secretively or dishonestly
Without knowing the population count of a city, and also without tampering with its == operator, we can search only by comparing its name with the vector's content.
converge
be adjacent or come together
The Mandelbrot set consists of all such values of c for which the formula converges if it is applied often enough.
constraint
the state of being physically limited
Just as for the search tree implementations, both containers have their multipendants: std::unordered_multiset and std::unordered_multimap both drop the constraint on the uniqueness of the objects/keys, so we can store multiple elements with the same key.
doe
the mature female of mammals such as deer
Lambda Expressions void operator()() { std::cout << "Hello, " << name << '\n'; } }; name_greeter greet_john_ doe {"John Doe"}; greet_john_ doe(); }
assignment
an undertaking that you have been told to perform
Yes, this would be completely correct, but imagine we stored some very large strings in every slot, or even another vector or map--in that situation, that little assignment would lead to a very expensive copy.
mimic
imitate, especially for satirical effect
A reverse iterator kind of contains a normal iterator and mimics its interface completely, but it rewires the increment operation to a decrement operation.
precision
the quality of being reproducible in amount or performance
All the numbers will be parsed and saved in double precision floating point, so it's going to be a stack of double values. stack val_stack;
traverse
journey across or pass over
Lists can only be traversed linearly with O(n) time.
fulfill
meet a want or need
And this requirement is also fulfilled by std::string, for example: std::string std::string std::string std::string
vanish
become invisible or unnoticeable
Now let's remove all the items with the value 2 from the vector. std::remove moves the other items in a way that the one value 2 we actually have in the vector vanishes.
cheap
relatively low in price or charging low prices
Although the last item has no connection to the actually selected item, it is in a special position: Removing the last item is cheap!
composed
serenely self-possessed and free from agitation
We can also put a whole map or list or whatever composed complex data structure into an any variable.
hence
from that fact or reason or as a result
Then, a call like v.erase(end, end); also does nothing, hence it is harmless.
variety
a category of things distinguished by a common quality
Chapter 2, STL Containers, explains how the STL's rich variety of container data structures
brief
of short duration or distance
No part of this book may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system, or transmitted in any form or by any means, without the prior written permission of the publisher, except in the case of brief quotations embedded in critical articles or reviews.
reserve
hold back or set aside, especially for future use
In order to get that, we will first instantiate a vector where all these word-frequency pairs fit in and move them from the map to the vector. vector> word_counts; word_counts. reserve(words.size()); move(begin(words), end(words), back_inserter(word_counts));
preserve
keep in safety and protect from harm, loss, or destruction
The algorithm will strictly preserve the order of all non-2 values while doing that.
profit
the advantageous quality of being beneficial
Profiting from the new bracket initializer rules How to do it...
fib
a trivial lie
We call it fib_range, and its constructor will accept one parameter that tells how far in the Fibonacci range we want to iterate: class fib_range { size_t end_n; public: fib_range(size_t end_n_) : end_n{end_n_} {}
agnostic
a person who claims the existence of God is unknowable
Explicit loops are rarely both better to read and as datastructure agnostic as standard algorithms.
versatile
having great diversity or variety
As we can see, the matches helper function is quite versatile--it can be called on vectors or even on strings directly.
novice
someone new to a field or activity
Using the erase-remove idiom on std::vector A lot of novice C++ programmers learn about std::vector, that it basically works like an automatically growing array, and stop right there.
untouched
emotionally unmoved
It works exactly the same way as the map function, but it leaves the input untouched, while the map function transforms it using a transform function.
flaw
an imperfection in an object or machine
In order to keep the example simple, we did not do anything about this, but if we do publish the Fibonacci iterator as a library, it would become apparent that it has a usability flaw--a fibit instance that was created with a constructor parameter will only be used as an end iterator because it does not contain valid Fibonacci values.
assuming
excessively forward or presumptuous
We can even do that in a loop, assuming we have a whole vector of those: int main() { std::vector employees { /* Initialized from somewhere */}; for (const auto &[id, name, role, salary] : employees) { std::cout << "Name: " << name so-called doubtful or suspect This pretty and short, so-called, range-based for loop has been in existence since C++11.
excess
the state of being more than full
In this section, we will implement a slick whitespace filtering algorithm, which removes excess whitespace from strings but leaves single whitespace characters untouched.
detach
cause to become separated
An alternative to joining is detaching.
omit
leave undone or leave out
Modern compilers support return value optimization (RVO), which enables for omitting intermediate copies.
identity
the characteristics by which a thing or person is known
When using binary folds in order to implement the no-argument case, the notion of an identity element is often important--in this case, adding a 0 to any number changes nothing, which makes 0 an identity element.
imply
express or state indirectly
However, the information contained in this book is sold without warranty, either express or implied.
precise
sharply exact or accurate or delimited
Wow, this is a very precise description of what went wrong.
impose
charge and collect payment
Interestingly, this function is very versatile because the only requirement it imposes on the types we use is that they are comparable with the <= operator.
grasp
hold firmly
So, we make sure we grasp these concepts in this chapter.
distribute
give to several people
A good hash function tries to distribute values as evenly over the whole value range as possible, in order to reduce the amount of hash collisions. result_type operator()(const argument_type &c) const { return static_cast(c.x) + static_cast(c.y);
significant
rich in implication
In this case, the handcrafted loop variant is not much longer, and it is also not significantly harder to read than a one-liner which says what it does: accumulate.
track
a line or route along which something travels or moves
It is used in audio/image/video compression, audio filters, medical imaging devices, cell phone apps that identify music tracks while listening to them on the fly, and so on.
visible
capable of being seen or open to easy view
If we calculate the error in a continuous manner, first for the first pair of items, then for the first two pairs of items, then for the first three pairs of items, and so on, then we get the accumulated error curve, which is visible on the plotted graph as shown:
flow
move along, of liquids
The flow is similar to the diagram in the recipe about shared pointers.
tie
fasten or secure with a rope, string, or cord
Before C++17, it was possible to achieve a similar effect using std:: tie: int remainder; std:: tie(std::ignore, remainder) = divide_remainder(16, 5); std::cout << "16 % 5 is " << remainder << '\n';
fresh
recently made, produced, or harvested
Create a fresh key-value pair.
thus
from that fact or reason or as a result
Thus, the key being inserted is parameter k and the associated value is constructed from the parameter pack args.
randomness
the quality of lacking any predictable order or plan
This device tries to distribute the randomness equally over all the possible values: cout << "random_device" << '\n'; histogram(partitions, samples);
cologne
a perfumed liquid made of essential oils and alcohol
STL Algorithm Basics { auto found_ cologne (find(begin(c), end(c), city{" Cologne", 1060000})); print_city(found_ cologne); }
equivalence
essential comparability and interchangeability
We can also test for the equivalence of two paths that are not canonical. equivalence canonicalizes the paths, which it accepts as arguments and returns true if they describe the same path after all.
semantic
of or relating to meaning or the study of meaning
All the branches of a constexpr-if construct need to be syntactically well-formed, but the branches that are not taken do not need to be semantically valid.
iota
a tiny or scarcely detectable amount
We fill this vector using std:: iota with the value range, 0 ... (w*h - 1).
downside
a negative aspect of something that is generally positive
The downside of this approach is that this always needlessly reallocates some memory, which sounds bad in terms of performance.
snippet
a small piece of anything
Instead of doing it as shown in the preceding code snippet, we can now assign the individual values to individual variables with expressive names, which is much better to read: auto [fraction, remainder] = divide_remainder(16, 3); std::cout << "16 / 3 is " << fraction << " with a remainder of " << remainder << '\n';
computation
the procedure of calculating
Especially when doing numeric computations with indexed members which need to be really fast, it is advantageous to stick to [] indexed access.
convertible
designed to be changed from one use or form to another
The trick here is that our lambda [](double, double) { return /* some double */ } is convertible to a function pointer that actually matches that pointer description.
consuming
very intense
They help build strings in memory, and/or consuming data from them.
specialty
an asset of special worth or utility
There were three specialties in this recipe.
straightforward
pointed directly ahead
Using STL algorithms is good for: Maintainability: The names of the algorithms already state in a straightforward manner what they do.
clause
a separate section of a legal document
It contains the same using type alias clauses as other hash specializations. namespace std { template <> struct hash { using argument_type = coord; using result_type = size_t;
varying
marked by diversity or difference
The std::vector comes into play when array-like storage is needed, but with varying sizes.
corresponding
similar especially in position or purpose
Measuring the difference between signals consisting of many data points usually involves loops and subtraction of corresponding data points, and so on.
comply
act in accordance with someone's rules, commands, or wishes
But nevertheless, std::copy users automatically profit from it if their argument types comply with the requirements of this optimization.
facility
a building or place that provides a particular service
As of today, C++ is a language that provides language features and standard library facilities for sophisticated standard data structures and algorithms, automatic resource management pointers, lambda expressions, constant expressions, portable thread control for concurrent programming, regular expressions, random number generators, exceptions, variadic templates...
declaration
a statement that is emphatic and explicit
It's their return type declaration, which makes them look complicated, and which contains a trick--an expression such as std::enable_if_t evaluates to type if condition is true.
provoke
provide the needed stimulus for
...error handling less clumsy compared to old-school C-style code, which is riddled with loads of if branches, which handle errors after every step. If we played around trying to provoke various reasons for streams to fail, we would realize that there are no different exceptions being thrown. This way, we can only find out when we get an error,...
prior
earlier in time
No part of this book may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system, or transmitted in any form or by any means, without the prior written permission of the publisher, except in the case of brief quotations embedded in critical articles or reviews.
horrible
provoking horror
It looks horribly complicated because it unpacks the parameter pack ts into another lambda expression, which recursively calls concat again, with less parameters: template
appropriate
suitable for a particular person, place, or situation
Packt Publishing has endeavored to provide trademark information about all of the companies and products mentioned in this book by the appropriate use of capitals.
valuable
having worth or merit
We award our regular reviewers with free eBooks and videos in exchange for their valuable feedback.
extent
the point or degree to which something extends
Python is not a purely functional language, but it supports similar patterns to some extent, as seen in the next example:
invent
come up with after a mental effort
It was invented nearly 200 years ago, but with computers, the number of use cases for it really skyrocketed.
waste
use inefficiently or inappropriately
We will learn how to use them, so we can be productive by concentrating on solutions, instead of wasting time reinventing the wheel.
vary
become different in some particular way
The execution speed of this code will vary a lot, depending on the computer this code is executed on.
guide
someone employed to conduct others
If there is a topic that you have expertise in and you are interested in either writing or contributing to a book, see our author guide at www.packtpub.com/authors.
wise
having intelligence and discernment
The expression, make_tuple(xs, ys)..., groups the parameter packs item wise.
argue
have a disagreement about something
A lot of people will still prefer this over returning complex structures like pairs, tuples, and structs, arguing that this way the code would be faster, due to avoided intermediate copies of those values.
glance
take a brief look at
A glance at a possible implementation of std::inner_product shows us why and how this works: template T inner_product(InIt1 it1, InIt1 end1, InIt2 it2, T val, F bin_op1, G bin_op2) { while (it1 != end1) { val = bin_op1(val, bin_op2(*it1, *it2)); ++it1; ++it2; } return value; }
latter
the second of two or the second mentioned of two
What does the latter mean?
sanitize
make sterile by cleaning
The GCC and LLVM project homepages list their sanitizing capabilities in their online documentation pages: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html http://clang.llvm.org/docs/index.html(look for sanitizers in the table of
garble
distort or make false by mutilation or addition
If they did, that would garble the output.
interchangeable
permitting mutual substitution without loss of function
The size of the hash table can be manipulated by the user, and the hash function can also be chosen individually, which is important, because the performance versus space consumption characteristics depend on that. std::unordered_set and std::unordered_map have so much interface in common with their std::set and std::map pendants, that they can be used almost interchangeably.
standardize
cause to conform to a norm
The C++ standard does not only standardize the language, as it needs to be understood by the compilers, but also the C++ standard template library (STL).
intuitive
spontaneously derived from or prompted by a natural tendency
In order to merge two sorted ranges of items, we would intuitively create a new range and feed it with items from both the lists.
feasible
capable of being done with means at hand
It is not feasible to always activate all available sanitizers because they make the program slower.
pivot
axis consisting of a shaft supporting something that turns
The iterators a and c mark the whole range, and iterator b points to a pivot element.
counterpart
a person or thing having the same function as another
It has the purpose of being the counterpart of the comparison which shall act as the abort condition in every iteration: istream_iterator end;
advantageous
giving a benefit
Especially when doing numeric computations with indexed members which need to be really fast, it is advantageous to stick to [] indexed access.
termination
the act of ending something
This iteration termination method will help you in implementing your own iterators wherever you run into a situation where the comparison with an end position approach is not helpful.
aggregate
a sum total of many heterogeneous things taken together
Its purpose was to allow for aggregate initialization, but also for usual constructor calling.
dividend
a number to be divided by another number
Then, we can have a look at multiple examples that show how we can do it in C++17: Accessing individual values of an std::pair: Imagine we have a mathematical function, divide_remainder, which accepts a dividend and a divisor parameter and returns the fraction of both as well as the remainder.
furthermore
in addition
Furthermore, using {} brackets will select the only matching constructor, while initializer lines using () parentheses try to match the closest constructor and even do type conversion in order to match.
thrice
three times
Let's begin with the main function, where we define two cheap simple function objects: int main() { auto twice ([] (int i) { return i * 2; }); auto thrice ([] (int i) { return i * 3; });
detached
no longer connected or joined
Output iterator Output iterators are detached from the other categories.
assumption
the act of taking something for granted
Let's compile and run the program to see if the output matches our assumptions: $ ./finding_items
seemingly
from appearances alone
Seemingly, just because there are less obvious use cases for it, a lot of developers do not even know about its existence.
expansion
the act of increasing in size or volume or quantity or scope
Here, the expression f(x, rest), together with the ... parameter pack expansion generates the function calls f(1, 1), f(1, 2), and so on, which results in the pairs being printed.
wildly
to an extreme or greatly exaggerated degree
We construct a string, which consists of wildly interleaved 'a' and '_' characters: int main() { auto is_a ([](char c) { return c == 'a'; }); string a {"a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a"};
eliminate
end, take out, or do away with
It tells the compiler that it can eliminate the function call by taking its implementation and directly putting it where it was called.
forbidden
excluded from use or mention
We will use one helper function in order to crop possibly appended commas, dots, or colons from words. string filter_punctuation(const string &s) { const char * forbidden {".,:; "}; const auto idx_start (s.find_first_not_of( forbidden)); const auto idx_end (s.find_last_not_of( forbidden)); return s.substr(idx_start, idx_end - idx_start + 1); }
accuracy
the quality of being near to the true value
Every effort has been made in the preparation of this book to ensure the accuracy of the information presented.
awkward
lacking grace or skill in manner or movement or performance
In a lot of cases, however, it is awkward to read a 10-line code loop just to realize, "Did I just have to study the whole loop in order to understand that it does a standard task, X?",
elaborate
marked by complexity and richness of detail
One thing we could elaborate on a bit is the fact that we used std::cin and an std::ifstream instance in a completely interchangeable way.
coin
a flat metal piece (usually a disc) used as money
Implementing an ASCII Mandelbrot renderer In 1975, the mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot coined the term fractal.
opt
select as an alternative over another
When used for printing, it will compare its iterator argument against the end iterator and then print the item or, otherwise, just : template static auto opt_print (const C &container) { return [end_it (end(container))] (const auto &item) { if (item != end_it) { cout << *item << '\n'; } else { cout << "\n"; } }; }
rarely
not often
Explicit loops are rarely both better to read and as datastructure agnostic as standard algorithms.
involved
connected by participation or association or use
This way, there's not much overhead involved in most cases.
assemble
create by putting components or members together
It is possible to hack together all the code for an ASCII Mandelbrot image in something around 20 lines of code, but we will implement each logical step in a separate form, and then assemble all the steps in the end.
interpret
make sense of; assign a meaning to
However, before doing this, we apply std::hex and std::showbase to tell the output stream object cout that it should print numbers in the hexadecimal format and that it should prepend "0x" to them so that it is obvious that they are to be interpreted as hex: cout << hex << showbase; print_aligned_demo(0x123abc, 15);
consult
seek information from
The std::sample algorithm works similar to std::copy, but it takes two additional parameters: the number of samples, which it shall take from the input range, and a random number generator object, which it will consult to get random sampling positions: sample(begin(v), end(v), back_inserter(samples), sample_points, mt19937{random_device{}()});
scheme
an elaborate and systematic plan of action
For normal text, it is of reduced utility because normal language is usually not so repetitive that its text representation would become shorter with this compression scheme.
bold
fearless and daring
New terms and important words are shown in bold.
purchase
acquire by means of a financial transaction
Customer support Now that you are the proud owner of a Packt book, we have a number of things to help you to get the most from your purchase.
throughout
from first to last
Throughout the book, we have often been printing a container's content using the std::copy function.
aware
having or showing knowledge or understanding or realization
Thorough testing with sanitizers is something that every programmer should be aware of and should always be doing.
reside
live in
We are only comparing the step at which the Fibonacci iterators currently reside, which makes it easier to define the end iterator for step 1000000, for example, as we do not need to expensively calculate such a high Fibonacci number in advance: bool operator!=(const fibit &o) const { return i != o.i;
prefer
like better; value more highly
A lot of people will still prefer this over returning complex structures like pairs, tuples, and structs, arguing that this way the code would be faster, due to avoided intermediate copies of those values.
demand
request urgently and forcefully
Fully searchable across every book published by Packt Copy and paste, print, and bookmark content On demand and accessible via a web browser
strength
the property of being physically or mentally powerful
This is very sad because using C++ like that means dropping half its strength.
employ
put into service
The filtering using a predicate was added by us by wrapping the copy_and_advance function object into another function object, which employs a predicate function: template auto filter(T predicate) { return [=] (auto reduce_fn) { return [=] (auto accum, auto input) { if (predicate(input)) { return reduce_fn(accum, input); } else {
fair
free from favoritism, bias, or deception
Fair enough; we do not need a library for that (although randomness experts know that just using the lowest few bits of a random number does not always lead to high-quality random numbers).
reassign
move somebody to a different position or location of work
We should usually not access items that were a move source before we reassigned them, but let's ignore that for the sake of this experiment: $ ./copying_items
uniqueness
the quality of being one of a kind
uniqueness of the key objects.
verbose
using or containing too many words
The GNU STL implementation has a debug mode, and the GNU C++ compiler as well as the LLVM clang C++ compiler both support additional libraries that can be used to produce extra-sensitive and verbose binaries for us, which immediately blow up on a large variety of bugs.
quirky
strikingly unconventional
Such code quickly leads to quirky looking and unsafe code.
alignment
the spatial property possessed by things in a straight line
Pointer alignment: Some architectures cannot access memory if it has a weird alignment in memory.
facet
a distinct feature or element in a problem
Most operating systems provide possibilities to control also these facets of multiprogramming, but such features are, at this point, not included in the STL.
dolor
(poetry) painful grief
# # et #574 dolor #302 sed #273 diam #273 sit #259 ipsum #259 ...
asterisk
a star-shaped character used in printing
By dividing its counter value by max_div and print so many asterisk symbols '*', we get histogram lines that fit into the terminal: for (size_t i {0}; i < partitions; ++i) { cout << setw(2) << i << ": " << string(v[i] / max_div, '*') << '\n'; } }
colon
the part of the large intestine between the cecum and rectum
We will use one helper function in order to crop possibly appended commas, dots, or colons from words. string filter_punctuation(const string &s) { const char *forbidden {".,:; "}; const auto idx_start (s.find_first_not_of(forbidden)); const auto idx_end (s.find_last_not_of(forbidden)); return s.substr(idx_start, idx_end - idx_start + 1); }
badger
sturdy carnivorous burrowing mammal with strong claws
2013 "Pepe" "Anthropomorphic frog" 2016 "Gabe" "Musical dog on maximum borkdrive" 2016 "Honey Badger" "Crazy nastyass honey badger" 2011 "Dramatic Chipmunk" "Chipmunk with a very dramatic look" 2007
unrelated
lacking a logical or causal linkage
This is important to know because if we print some output with certain formatting, we should tidy up our stream object formatting settings afterward, because the next output from unrelated code may otherwise look crazy.
delve
turn up, loosen, or remove earth
Without delving into the explanations of such foreign syntax, an important commonality in both examples is the magical zip function.
abbreviation
shortening something by omitting parts of it
Of course, the command line consists of strings, which we can convert to numbers using std::stoull (stoull is an abbreviation for string to unsigned long long): size_t partitions {stoull(argv[1])}; size_t samples {stoull(argv[2])};
intersection
the act of meeting at a point
std::replace_if std::reverse std::reverse_copy std::rotate std::rotate_copy std::search std::search_n std::set_difference std::set_ intersection std::set_symmetric_difference std::set_union std::sort std::stable_partition std::stable_sort std::swap_ranges std::transform std::transform_exclusive_scan std::transform_inclusive_scan std::transform_reduce std::uninitialized_copy std::uninitialized_copy_n std::uninitialized_fill std::uninitialized_fill_n std::unique std::unique_copy
inclusive
encompassing much or everything
There are also the seven new ones that support execution policies from the beginning (highlighted in bold): std::adjacent_difference std::adjacent_find std::all_of std::any_of std::copy std::copy_if std::copy_n std::count std::count_if std::equal std::exclusive_scan std::fill std::fill_n std::find std::find_end std::find_first_of std::find_if std::find_if_not std::for_each std::for_each_n std::generate std::generate_n std::includes std:: inclusive_scan std::inner_product
derivation
the source or origin from which something comes
The normal distribution accepts a mean value and a standard derivation as arguments: cout << "uniform_int_distribution\n"; print_distro(uniform_int_distribution{0, 9}, samples); cout << "normal_distribution\n"; print_distro(normal_distribution{0.0, 2.0}, samples);
exploited
developed or used to greatest advantage
It can be exploited easily.
pendant
an adornment that hangs from a piece of jewelry
The size of the hash table can be manipulated by the user, and the hash function can also be chosen individually, which is important, because the performance versus space consumption characteristics depend on that. std::unordered_set and std::unordered_map have so much interface in common with their std::set and std::map pendants, that they can be used almost interchangeably.
oscillate
move or swing from side to side regularly
It oscillates between the values -1 and +1 and has no other values than those.
misuse
improper handling or application of something
Automatically checking iterator code with checked iterators No matter how useful iterators are, and what generic interface they represent, iterators can easily be misused, just as pointers.
sanity
normal or sound powers of mind
We surround this code with a little sanity check.
waive
do without or cease to hold or adhere to
If the insertion hint is wrong, the insertion function will simply waive the hint and start over using the search algorithm.
enhanced
increased or intensified in value or beauty or quality
C++17 comes with an enhanced set of initializer rules.
criterion
the ideal in terms of which something can be judged
constexpr (optional) If we mark the lambda expression explicitly as constexpr, the compiler will error out if it does not satisfy the criteria of constexpr functions.
slick
made smooth, as by ice, grease, or water
In this section, we will implement a slick whitespace filtering algorithm, which removes excess whitespace from strings but leaves single whitespace characters untouched.
constellation
a configuration of stars as seen from the earth
In this constellation, the iterator it points to the beginning of the last slice, while slice_end points to the end of the last slice.
inactive
not engaged physically or mentally
It is just put into an inactive state by the operating system. wipe out use up (resources or materials)
This
way, it wipes out repeated characters as it can , for example, transform "abbbbbbc" to
"abc".
erroneous
containing or characterized by mistakes
In this case, this means that the compiler does not error out if the return value of one of those functions cannot be deduced from an erroneous template expression (which std::enable_if is, in case its condition evaluates to false).
specifically
in distinction from others
The pointer type, shared_ptr, was designed for specifically this case.
discount
an amount or percentage deducted
You can upgrade to the eBook version at www.PacktPub.com and as a print book customer, you are entitled to a discount on the eBook copy.
adjacent
having a common boundary or edge
There are also the seven new ones that support execution policies from the beginning (highlighted in bold): std:: adjacent_difference std:: adjacent_find std::all_of std::any_of std::copy std::copy_if std::copy_n std::count std::count_if std::equal std::exclusive_scan std::fill std::fill_n std::find std::find_end std::find_first_of std::find_if std::find_if_not std::for_each std::for_each_n std::generate std::generate_n std::includes std::inclusive_scan std::inner_product
greedy
immoderately desirous of acquiring something
It does this in a greedy manner, which means that it is not possible to match non-aggregate constructors (nonaggregate constructors are usual constructors in contrast to the ones that accept an initializer list). std::vector, for example, provides a specific non-aggregate constructor, which fills arbitrarily many items with the same value: std::vector v (N, value).
regardless
in spite of everything
In an empty set, both are the same, so we are not even allowed to dereference it, regardless if that is for reading from it or assigning to it.
collide
crash together with violent impact
Otherwise, the iterator points to the existing item, which would collide with the item to be inserted.
accompanying
occurring at the same time, along with, or as a consequence
It can easily be checked if this is true for a certain key and an accompanying hint.
clumsy
lacking grace in movement or posture
...file is not possible: ifstream f {"non_existant.txt"}; f.exceptions(...); // too late for an exception This is a pity because exceptions actually promise that they make error handling less clumsy compared to old-school C-style code, which is riddled with loads of if branches, which handle errors after every step. If we played around trying to provoke various reasons for...
equipped
provided with whatever is necessary for a purpose
Equipped with shared_ptr and unique_ptr, we can automatically deal with most dynamically allocated objects without having to worry about memory leaks any longer.
era
a period marked by distinctive character
parallelism and concurrency which became very important topics at the time we entered the era of multi-core processors.
consumption
the act of using something up
The size of the hash table can be manipulated by the user, and the hash function can also be chosen individually, which is important, because the performance versus space consumption characteristics depend on that. std::unordered_set and std::unordered_map have so much interface in common with their std::set and std::map pendants, that they can be used almost interchangeably.
profitable
yielding material gain
In this chapter, we'll concentrate on using STL algorithms for different problems in order to get a feeling of how they can be profitably put to use.
altered
changed in form or character without becoming something else
The source range is not altered. std::copy_if
bud
a partially opened flower
Please Enter two numbers: > a b Oh no, that did not go well! now please enter some comma-separated names: > bud spencer, terence hill,, name: " bud spencer" name: "terence hill"
masses
the common people generally
std::istream_iterator This class is really interesting in cases where we want to process masses of data of the same type from a stream, which is exactly the case in this recipe: we parse the whole input word by word and put it into the set in the form of std::string instances.
evolve
undergo development
The syntax of lambda expressions was really new in C++11, and it has slightly evolved with the next two standard versions until C++17.
seldom
not often
The additional rule introduced in C++17 affects the initialization with auto type deduction-while C++11 would correctly make the type of the variable auto x {123}; an std::initializer_list with only one element, this is seldom what we would want.
devoted
zealous in allegiance or affection
Introduction This chapter is devoted to string handling, parsing, and printing of arbitrary data.
capable
having ability
On my laptop with an Intel i7 processor with 4 hyperthreading capable cores (which results in eight virtual cores), the parallel version of this program ran more than 3-5 times faster compared to the original program.
aside
on or to one side
Aside from that, std::string provides a member function, append, which can handle string_view instances, but it alters the string instead of returning a new one with the string view content appended. std::string_view is useful, but be cautious when mixing it with strings
sink
fall or descend to a lower place or level
In such a situation, we would need to write our own hand-crafted algorithms that just deal with the question of how to shove data from the source to the sink.
ordinary
lacking special distinction, rank, or status
It is simple to use but still very useful, which makes it an ordinary standard component used in portable day-to-day programs.
edge
a line determining the limits of an area
Requirements for early adopters If you happen to read this book in the earliest days of C++17 and use bleeding- edge compilers to compile the code, you might experience that some recipes do not compile yet.
deny
declare untrue; contradict
symbolic links to directories skip_permission_ denied: This tells the iterator to skip directories that would otherwise result in errors because permission to access is denied by the filesystem These options can be combined with the | operator.
fashion
the latest and most admired style in clothes or behavior
The algorithm may be executed with multiple threads that share the work in a parallel fashion.
apparent
clearly revealed to the mind or the senses or judgment
In order to keep the example simple, we did not do anything about this, but if we do publish the Fibonacci iterator as a library, it would become apparent that it has a usability flaw--a fibit instance that was created with a constructor parameter will only be used as an end iterator because it does not contain valid Fibonacci values.
ancient
belonging to times long past
...course, not true for exception handling in general, but for the STL stream library). That is why we additionally consulted the value of errno. This global variable is an ancient construct, which has already been used in the old days when there were no C++ or exceptions in general. If any system-related function has seen an error condition, it...
suit
a set of garments for outerwear of the same fabric and color
In this recipe, we create an example class that could suit as a member of a typical headeronly library.
major
greater in scope or effect
The major difference from unique_ptr is that we can copy the shared_ptr instances because shared pointers maintain a so-called control block together with the object they manage.
refuse
show unwillingness towards
As soon as one of these items cannot be parsed from the input stream, the input stream object enters an error state and refuses to parse anything further.
suffice
be adequate, either in quality or quantity
C++ programs do often consist of multiple C++ source files (these do have .cpp or .cc suffices).
occupy
live in (a certain place)
In order to make the vector occupy only as much memory as it needs, we make the shrink_to_fit call in the end.
influence
a power to affect persons or events
When printing floating-point numbers, there are also a lot of things we may want to have an influence on.
certainly
definitely or positively
...Mixed formatting: 123 +1.230000E+02 123.456 Catching readable exceptions from std::iostream errors In none of the recipes in this chapter, we used exceptions to catch errors. While this is certainly possible, working on stream objects without exceptions is already very convenient. If we try to parse in 10 values, but this fails somewhere in the middle, the whole stream...
immediate
directly before or after as in a chain of cause and effect
Enables or disables immediate output buffer flushing after any output operation
suffer
undergo or be subjected to
While on this little trip, we will also see where exactly STL algorithms suffer from reusability or prettiness.
desire
the feeling that accompanies an unsatisfied state
These are then linked together with the modules that desire to use these functions.
till
work land as by ploughing to make it ready for cultivation
All items from index 10 till (signal_length - 10) are set to 0.0.
stochastic
being or having a random variable
Everyone who ever had stochastic as a topic in maths at school will most probably have heard about these already.
humongous
very large
If the creation and/or destruction of specific types of objects relies on specific factory functions' deleter interfaces, does this prevent us from getting the humongous benefits of smart pointers?
unstructured
lacking definite organization
The goal is to provide an unstructured list, and then the priority queue tells us what to do in which order.
homogenize
make uniform or consistent throughout
Some people might prefer to homogenize all extensions.
modular
constructed with standardized, prefabricated units or pieces
Keep your code modular by using stream abstractions.
unmodified
not changed in form or character
The trade-off of this decision is that it is slightly slower than the unmodified version of Boyer-Moore, but it also needs fewer data structures for its operation.
achievable
capable of existing or taking place or proving true
This sounds like a lot of hassle, but if we want to simply remove whitespace from a string, for example, this should be achievable without much code.
cyclic
marked by repeated series of events
Shared pointers should not be used in this case because such cyclic reference chains prevent the use counter of such objects to ever reach 0.
sneaky
marked by quiet and caution and secrecy
If not, you have the unique chance to fix important and sneaky bugs on your first day at work!
sporadically
in an irregular or unpredictable manner
This type allows us to sporadically bundle multiple values into a single variable and reach them around.
skewed
having an oblique or slanting direction or position
Since we measured the time distance, or duration from one absolute point in time and the other absolute point in time (which we captured in the variables tic and toc), we are not interested if those points in time were globally skewed. ad hoc for or concerned with one specific purpose The numbers are generated ad hoc while iterating.
pseudo
not genuine but having the appearance of
With the STL algorithms, std::transform and std::accumulate, we wrote code, which can be summarized to the following pseudo code: transform(num_iterator{0}, num_iterator{s.size()}, ... accumulate((num_iterator0}, num_iterator{s.size()}, ... c + s[k] * polar(1.0, pol * k * j / double(s.size()));
retroactive
affecting things past
The more our old programs utilize STL algorithms, the easier we can add parallelism to them retroactively.
misspell
write the letters of incorrectly
A simply misspelled path in such a program can lead to a program that greedily removes too many files in unwanted ways.
aforementioned
being the one previously spoken of
Contiguous iterator This category specifies all of the aforementioned requirements, plus the requirement that the data that is being iterated through lies in contiguous memory, like it does in an array, or std::vector.
invasive
gradually intrusive without right or permission
While such an upgrade might be pretty invasive for the implementation, not much has changed in terms of their interface--they all got an additional ExecutionPolicy&& policy argument, and that's it.
conceptual
being or characterized by ideas or their formation
Tasks where we simply transport data between conceptually different data structures can be implemented with a one-liner code, thanks to another abstraction provided by the STL: iterator adapters.
knowledgeable
alert and fully informed
There's more… This section consists of additional information about the recipe in order to make the reader more knowledgeable about the recipe.
supplemental
functioning in a supporting capacity
Both list all files in a directory and provide supplemental information such as file size, permissions, and so on.
seamless
not having a joint between two pieces
...result of the measurement between units, such as seconds, milliseconds, and microseconds. The STL provides facilities, which enable us to define our own time units and convert between them seamlessly. [ 323 ] Utility Classes How to do it... In this section, we will write a little game that prompts the user to enter a...
reestablish
bring back into original existence, function, or position
Now, we reestablish the original item ordering by using std::sort.
caveat
a warning against certain acts
There is, however, one important caveat to consider--imagine we have two objects on the heap that contain shared pointers to each other, and some other shared pointer points to one of them from somewhere else.
gimmick
any clever maneuver
Another gimmick of std::optional is optional::value_or.
skyrocket
shoot up abruptly, like a rocket
It was invented nearly 200 years ago, but with computers, the number of use cases for it really skyrocketed.
cryptic
having a secret or hidden meaning
...About : https://isocpp.org/about Current ISO C++ status : https://isocpp.org/std/status (...and many more...) How it works... Regular expressions (or regex in short) are extremely useful. They can look really cryptic, but it is worth learning how they work. A short regex can spare us writing many lines of code if we did the matching manually. In this recipe, we...
pointless
serving no useful purpose; having no excuse for being
At first, this search looks pointless because we get exactly the item we searched for.
flawless
without a weakness or defect
Compiling and running this program leads to a flawless execution.
circumvent
surround so as to force to give up
There are two easy ways to circumvent this problem: // 1.) function(make_shared (), make_shared(), other_function()); // 2.) shared_ptr ap {new A{}}; shared_ptr bp {new B{}}; function(ap, bp, other_function());
erroneously
in a mistaken manner
This way print_exclusive will not block on an erroneously still locked mutex: try { exclusive_throw(); } catch (int e) { cout << "Got exception " << e << '\n'; } print_exclusive(); }
orchestrate
plan and direct (a complex undertaking)
It will use it to orchestrate the threads: static void print(size_t x) { std::call_once(callflag, once_print); cout << x; }
negligible
so small as to be meaningless; insignificant
In any other situation, the at function helps uncovering bugs with usually negligible performance loss.
willful
done by design
By implementing code that willfully causes a deadlock, we've seen how quick such an unwanted scenario can happen.
meticulous
marked by precise accordance with details
Special thanks go to Arne Mertz for his invaluable and meticulous review suggestions, as well as Torsten Robitzki and Oliver Bruns from the C++ user group Hannover for their great feedback.
divisible
capable of being or liable to be divided or separated
If we are on a row end (because the counter variable n is evenly divisible by w), we print a line break symbol: auto binfunc ([w, n{0}] (auto output_it, int x) mutable { *++output_it = (x > 50 ? '*' : ' '); if (++n % w == 0) { ++output_it = '\n'; } return output_it; });
blatant
without any attempt at concealment; completely obvious
However, apart from implementation details, there is one blatant error source when using create_symlink or create_hard_link.
evaluation
the act of ascertaining or judging the quality of
The function is executed by the same thread, but later (lazy evaluation).
pitfall
an unforeseen or unexpected or surprising difficulty
This is a special pitfall
permissible
acceptable, especially as according to rule
In addition to that, it is permissible to vectorize the code.
unified
formed or joined into a whole
This way, we can not only start and stop threads without external libraries but also synchronize them with abstractions from a single unified library: the STL.
underestimate
make too low an approximation of
The amount of work and thought needed in order to really and correctly make such classes generic is not to be underestimated.
brevity
the attribute of being short or fleeting
Here we just have one for brevity.
spurious
plausible but false
The nice thing about the wait call checking the predicate is that if there is a spurious wakeup call, the thread will go to sleep immediately again.
manageable
capable of being controlled
Now, let's make such objects manageable by shared_ptr.
archaic
so extremely old as seeming to belong to an earlier period
It was always necessary to call functions of the C library, which looks very archaic, considering that such calls could be encapsulated nicely into their own classes.
warranty
written assurance that a product or service will be provided
However, the information contained in this book is sold without warranty, either express or implied.
unconditional
not qualified by reservations
The std::transform unconditionally copies all items from a source range to a destination range but transforms them in between.
deviation
a variation from the standard or norm
Any normal distribution can be characterized by the mean value and the standard deviation from the mean value: const int mean {10}; const size_t dev {3};
proofread
read for errors
Proofreader Safis Editing
concise
expressing much in few words
If we want to take an optional's value and fall back to a default value if it is in the empty state, then this is of help. x = optional_var.value_or(123) does this job in one concise line, where 123 is the fallback default value.
reminiscent
serving to bring to mind
Ok, that was maybe kind of a crazy ride that was slightly reminiscent of the movie "Inception" because of the lambda expressions that return lambda expressions.
emptiness
the state of containing nothing
Otherwise, we return a default constructed optional, which signals failure or emptiness: oint read_int() { int i; if (cin >> i) { return {i}; } return {}; }
leverage
the mechanical advantage gained by a machine on a fulcrum
Over 90 recipes that leverage the powerful features of the standard library in C++17
piracy
the act of plagiarizing
Piracy Piracy of copyrighted material on the Internet is an ongoing problem across all media.
crane
a long-necked wading bird
In order to get the traffic flow going again, we either need a large crane that randomly picks one car from the center of the street intersection and removes it.
substitution
putting one thing or person in the place of another
One could also put it that it works in a similar manner to preprocessor #if and #else text substitution macros, but for those, the code would not even have to be syntactically well-formed.
avalanche
a slide of large masses of snow, ice and mud down a mountain
Then, when we called result(), we unleashed a little avalanche of async and .get() calls that come just in the right order to not block each other.
ongoing
currently happening
Piracy Piracy of copyrighted material on the Internet is an ongoing problem across all media.
leash
restraint consisting of a rope used to restrain an animal
We will start multiple threads and see how our program behaves when we unleash multiple processor cores to execute parts of its code at the same time: 1.
derivative
a compound obtained from another compound
Then, at the same time, different operating systems use the slash / to separate directories (Linux, MacOS, and different UNIX derivatives), or the backslash \ (Windows).
drawback
a feature that makes something less convenient or acceptable
The drawbacks of such an approach are the following ones: If the parallel function comes from a library, the user must not forget to call the setup function.
shiny
reflecting light
Smart pointers are a shiny example of automatic memory management.
ignite
cause to start burning
In order to ignite some inspiration, let's have a look at some more little helpers that we can implement using this feature.
differentiate
acquire a distinct character
We are not going to differentiate between what is awkward and what is not; we'll only explore the possibilities.
prune
cultivate, tend, and cut back the growth of
In this section, we are filling an std::vector instance with some example integers, and then prune some specific items away from it.
inequality
lack of balance or similarity in status
The inequality of the partition counters wildly differs between individual engines.
frustration
an act of hindering someone's plans or efforts
By doing so, you can save other readers from frustration and help us improve subsequent versions of this book.
uneven
not fairly matched as opponents
Filtering out all uneven numbers from a numeric vector, and transforming the rest to strings: std::vector v {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}; auto rng = v | view::remove_if([](int i){return i % 2 == 1;}) | view::transform([](int i){return std::to_string(i);}); // rng == {"2"s,"4"s,"6"s,"8"s,"10"s};
dice
a small cube with 1 to 6 spots on the six faces
The linker can't just roll the dice.
regularity
the quality of being characterized by a fixed rate
We are pushing the boundaries a bit in order to prepare ourselves for modern C++, where functional programming patterns occur with increasing regularity.
resurrect
cause to become alive again
After leaving that scope also, our standard output is resurrected and the last line of text output will be readable in the shell again: cout << "Readable from normal stdout again\n"; }
livery
a uniform, especially worn by servants and chauffeurs
Livery Place 35 Livery Street
Birmingham
B3 2PB, UK.
blindly without seeing or looking It takes no arguments because it will blindly consume until the queue runs empty.
frustrated
disappointingly unsuccessful
If you see lambda expressions in the coming recipes that return lambda expressions, which again return lambda expressions, please don't feel frustrated or confused too quickly.
horde
a vast multitude
One situation that condition_variable solves elegantly for us is the following: If a consumer fires the go_produce notification, there might be a horde of producers racing to produce the next item.
archives
collection of records especially about an institution
Before compressing files in archives, a very simple way to reduce disk usage is just deleting duplicate files.
trio
a set of three similar things considered as a unit
When we understand how all classes from the trio consisting of istream, ostream and iostream can be used, we basically are ready to immediately put all following ones to use, too: ifstream, ofstream and fstream inherit from istream, ostream and iostream
retrieve
get or find back; recover the use of
From the character positions we retrieved from these functions in our helper function, we built us a substring without surrounding whitespace, using string::substring.
surprisingly
in a manner causing wonder or amazement
Surprisingly, its class definition can stay completely empty: class cstring_iterator_sentinel {};
dangle
hang freely
The weak pointer still needs the control block in order to distinguish if it dangles or not.
exclusion
a deliberate act of omission
Mutex classes The term mutex stands for mutual exclusion.
inject
force or drive (a fluid or gas) into by piercing
This helps decouple source code parts and makes your code easy to test because you can just inject any other matching type of stream.
intentional
done or made or performed with purpose and intent
In this recipe, we are going to write code which intentionally provokes a deadlock situation.
revoke
cancel officially
...Its constructor saves the formatting flags, which std::cout has set at the moment. Its destructor restores them to the state it had when the constructor was called. This effectively revokes any formatting settings that were applied in between: class format_guard { decltype(cout.flags()) f {cout.flags()}; public: ~format_guard() { cout.flags(f); } }; 3. Another little helper class is scientific_type. Because...
relentless
never-ceasing
Help us be relentless in improving our products!
forgetful
(of memory) deficient in retentiveness or range
As soon as a forgetful programmer misses to unlock a mutex somewhere after locking it, or an exception is thrown while a mutex is still locked, things look ugly pretty quick.
controversial
marked by or capable of arousing disagreement
One can controversially argue about which initialization style is the best one.
collision
an accident resulting from violent impact of a moving object
A good hash function tries to distribute values as evenly over the whole value range as possible, in order to reduce the amount of hash collisions. result_type operator()(const argument_type &c) const { return static_cast(c.x) + static_cast(c.y);
taint
place under suspicion or cast doubt upon
The compiler selects the fastest implementation possible for the chosen algorithm, while the user code nicely expresses what the algorithm does without tainting the code with too many details of the how.
beneficial
promoting or enhancing well-being
Generating permutations of input sequences When testing code that must deal with sequences of inputs where the order of the arguments is not important, it is beneficial to test whether it results in the same output for all possible permutations of that input.
transmitted
occurring among members of a family usually by heredity
No part of this book may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system, or transmitted in any form or by any means, without the prior written permission of the publisher, except in the case of brief quotations embedded in critical articles or reviews.
monetary
relating to or involving money
left and right control where the padding for fixed-width prints (see setw) occurs. internal puts padding characters in the middle between integers and their negative sign, the hex prefix and a hexadecimally printed value, or monetary units and values.
imperative
requiring attention or action
It is magically different from the imperative programming which C or C++ programmers are used to.
advisable
worthy of being recommended or suggested; prudent or wise
The release function does that, but using this function is not advisable in most situations.
adjusted
altered to accommodate to certain requirements
While seconds is the simplest unit to describe, as it works with Period = ratio<1>, the others have to be adjusted.
constrain
hold back
C++17 comes with the great news that it does not constrain begin and end iterators to be of the same type.
premature
too soon or too hasty
Between the two iterator dereferences, we add another guarding if branch that checks whether we prematurely reached the end of the iterable range, just for safety: const string link {*it++}; if (it == end_it) { break; } const string desc {*it++};
monotonous
sounded or spoken in a tone unvarying in pitch
Its implementation can be based on the processor's timestamp counter, which always counts up monotonously since the system was started.
purchasing
the act of buying
Customer Feedback Thanks for purchasing this Packt book.
crisp
tender and brittle
The zip function for tuples The zip function accepts two tuples, but looks horribly complicated, although it has a very crisp implementation: template auto zip(const T1 &a, const T2 &b) { auto z ([](auto ...xs) { return [xs...](auto ...ys) enhance
increase
The std::stringstream,
std::ostringstream, and std::istringstream classes are much better suited for this, as they enhance the memory management while appending, and provide all the formatting features we know from streams in general.
clan
group of people related by blood or marriage
Let's compile the code with clan useful (the activation flag for checked iterators with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler is /D_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=1):
vigorously
in an energetic manner
The reason why this is so unfortunate is that it will vigorously improve the possibilities of writing expressive and fast code in C++ by composing complex functionality from generic and simple blocks of code.
unfair
marked by injustice, inequality, or bias
Apart from that, how do we model an unfair die whose sides do not all have the same probability?
imaginary
not based on fact; unreal
This way, the type alias cmplx stands for two coupled double values, which represent the real and the imaginary parts of a complex number.
comprehensive
including all or everything
The most comprehensive way to get to know the different distributions is playing around with the program we just wrote.
disastrous
having extremely unfortunate or dire consequences
This is disastrous for files that are larger than our system memory.
lurk
lie in wait or behave in a sneaky and secretive manner
Dealing with strings is generally not a hard thing, but the chances of implementing buffer overflow bugs lurk around a lot here if legacy C-style formatting functions are used.
elapse
pass by
...user input and measures how long it took the user to type the input. It takes no arguments and returns us the user input string as well as the elapsed time, bundled in a pair: static pair get_input() { string s; 6. We need to take the time from the beginning of the period during which user...
clue
evidence that helps to solve a problem
Apart from that, you are a good candidate for reading this book if you can identify yourself with one of the following bullet point descriptions: You have learned the basics of C++, but now, you don't have a clue where to go next, since the gap between your knowledge and the knowledge of an experienced C++ veteran is still large.
stability
the quality or attribute of being firm and steadfast
Every computer science student who was tortured with having to learn a majority of existing sorting algorithms (together with their performance and stability trade-offs for exams) knows that.
alteration
the act of revising
The std::sample function does not add random alterations to sample points with fixed offset but chooses completely random points; therefore, it works a bit differently from this example:
insight
clear or deep perception of a situation
We are going to write a program that is similar to the program we wrote in the unique_ptr recipe in order to get insights into the usage and principles of shared_ptr: 1.
sprinkle
scatter with liquid; wet lightly
...them are indeed so useful that we will most probably see them extremely often in any C++ program snippet in the future or have at least already seen them sprinkled over all other chapters in this book. The first two recipes are about measuring and taking the time. We will also see how to convert between different time units...
solely
without any others being included or involved
This class has the potential of relieving us forever from memory leaks (at least together with its companions shared_ptr and weak_ptr, but in this recipe, we solely concentrate on unique_ptr).
qualified
meeting the proper standards and requirements for a task
After installing a "z" in the tree, we knew that installing "y" will insert a new item just in front of the "z", which qualified it to be a correct hint.
intensity
high level or degree
In this vector, every data point represents the intensity and phase of a certain repetitive wave frequency, which is or is not a part of the original signal.
inspection
a formal or official examination
It is designed to hold variables of any kind and provides facilities that enable for type-safe inspection and access to it.
overwhelming
very intense
This might look very overwhelming at first, but we will get to use most of these classes in this chapter and get familiar with them class by class.
hover
hang in the air; fly or be suspended above
Hover the mouse pointer on the SUPPORT tab at the top.
reduction
the act of decreasing something
This looks really weird at first as most binary reduction functions accept arguments of identical types and then merge them together with some operation, just as std::plus does.
predecessor
one who goes before you in time
In linked lists (such as std::list), for example, a node can be removed by making its predecessor point to its successor.
illegal
prohibited by law or by official or accepted rules
If you come across any illegal copies of our works in any form on the Internet, please provide us with the location address or website name immediately so that we can pursue a remedy.
scratch
cut, scrape, or wear away the surface of
Using STL containers like this will only scratch the surface of how much they help writing clean, maintainable, and fast code.
preliminary
preceding or in preparation for something more important
Getting ready This section tells you what to expect in the recipe, and describes how to set up any software or any preliminary settings required for the recipe.
crude
belonging to an early stage of technical development
At this point, we are using STL data structures so intuitively that we can nicely avoid pointers, raw arrays, and other crude legacy structures.
deliberately
in a careful unhurried manner
In this section, we'll write a program that deliberately accesses an invalidated iterator: 1.
cluster
a grouping of a number of similar things
This algorithm removes clustered occurrences of whitespace, but no single spaces.
independence
freedom from control or influence of another or others
The good thing is that we get data-structure independence for free this way.
editorial
an article giving opinions or perspectives
At Packt, quality is at the heart of our editorial process.
barrier
a structure or object that impedes free movement
How it works... std:call_once works like a barrier.
infer
conclude by reasoning
But how did the priority queue infer that {2, "do homework"} is more important than {0, "watch tv"}, without us telling it to compare the numeric part?
stumble
miss a step and fall or nearly fall
We end up calling our own entry_size helper function recursively if we stumble upon subdirectories again. return accumulate(directory_iterator{entry}, {}, 0u, [](size_t accum, const directory_entry &e) { return accum + entry_size(e); }); }
corruption
use of a position of trust for dishonest gain
In order to prevent that concurrently running threads alter the same object in a non-orchestrated way that might lead to data corruption, we can use mutex objects.
foresee
realize beforehand
Before compiling and running the program, go through the code again and try to foresee what it will print to the terminal.
prolong
lengthen in time; cause to be or last longer
The expired function of weak_ptr tells us if the object it points to still really exists, because holding a weak pointer to an object does not prolong its lifetime!
alleged
doubtful or suspect
Neither the authors, nor Packt Publishing, and its dealers and distributors will be held liable for any damages caused or alleged to be caused directly or indirectly by this book.
hinder
be an obstacle to
But nothing hinders us from implementing our own.
digest
convert food into absorbable substances
Take your time to digest all of this.
choke
struggle for breath; have insufficient oxygen intake
The compiler immediately chokes on this and tells us about our mistake: error: type 'std::tuple' decomposes into 3 elements, but only 2 names were provided auto [a, b] = tup;
legitimate
in accordance with accepted standards or principles
Just to list a few valuable examples: Out-of-bounds: This triggers whenever we access an array, vector, or anything similar outside its legitimate memory range.
lap
the upper side of the thighs of a seated person
Let's say that during one race lap, Bowser had a little accident and dropped to the last place and Donkey Kong Jr. took the chance to jump from the last place to the third place.
successor
a person who follows next in order
In linked lists (such as std::list), for example, a node can be removed by making its predecessor point to its successor.
adhere
stick to firmly
This adheres to the erase-remove idiom, which we already know from vectors and lists.
liable
subject to legal action
Neither the authors, nor Packt Publishing, and its dealers and distributors will be held liable for any damages caused or alleged to be caused directly or indirectly by this book.
dislike
a feeling of aversion or disapproval
Let us know what you think about this book-what you liked or disliked.
respective
considered individually
It does also work between unordered_map and unordered_multimap instances, as well as with set/multiset and respective unordered_set/unordered_multiset.
award
give, especially as an honor
We award our regular reviewers with free eBooks and videos in exchange for their valuable feedback.
endeavor
attempt by employing effort
Packt Publishing has endeavored to provide trademark information about all of the companies and products mentioned in this book by the appropriate use of capitals.
blast
a sudden very loud noise
However, we are not going much into that direction, as this would quickly blast the scope of this book.
subtle
difficult to detect or grasp by the mind or analyze
Also, there are many subtle edges in iterator code that can lead to bugs, so an iterator solution needs more tedious testing.
obligation
the state of being bound to do or pay something
Safely postponing initialization with std::call_once Sometimes we have specific code sections that can be run in parallel context by multiple threads with the obligation that some setup code must be executed exactly once before executing the actual functions.
cautious
showing careful forethought
Aside from that, std::string provides a member function, append, which can handle string_view instances, but it alters the string instead of returning a new one with the string view content appended. std::string_view is useful, but be cautious when mixing it with strings
entitled
qualified for by right according to law
You can upgrade to the eBook version at www.PacktPub.com and as a print book customer, you are entitled to a discount on the eBook copy.
suitable
meant or adapted for an occasion or use
The std::make_tuple is a really nice helper because it automatically deduces the type of all the arguments and creates a suitable tuple type: int main() { auto student_desc (make_tuple("ID", "Name", "GPA")); auto student (make_tuple(123456, "John Doe", 3.7));
enforce
compel to behave in a certain way
Our tiny library does not enforce such usage.
remedy
a medicine or therapy that cures disease or relieves pain
If you come across any illegal copies of our works in any form on the Internet, please provide us with the location address or website name immediately so that we can pursue a remedy.
mock
treat with contempt
Let's mock an output-heavy function, so we can play with it later: void my_output_heavy_function() { cout << "some output\n"; cout << "this function does really heavy work\n"; cout << "... and lots of it...\n"; // ...
intent
an anticipated outcome that guides your planned actions
This way, the programmer can lean back and express his intent, while the compiler can choose the optimal implementation for the given task.
abrupt
exceedingly sudden and unexpected
If we don't do one of the two, the destructor of the thread object will call std::terminate(), which leads to an abrupt application shutdown.
sketch
preliminary drawing for later elaboration
The std::begin and std::end functions both accept a vector instance as parameter, and return us iterators, which point to the first item, and past the last item, just as sketched in the upcoming diagram.
plainly
in a simple manner without extravagance
For directories or other special files, we plainly return a size of 0.
qualify
prove capable or fit; meet requirements
In order to prevent the user from modifying the key items of perfectly sorted map nodes, the const qualifier is added to the key type.
luxury
something that is an indulgence rather than a necessity
Apart from that, we get a lot of the luxury interface we know from std::string already.
formerly
at a previous time
If we design functions which formerly accepted std::string instances as parameters, but did not change them in a way that would require the string instances to reallocate the memory that holds the actual string payload, we could now use std::string_view and be more compatible with libraries that are STL-agnostic.
pile
a collection of objects laid on top of each other
If we regularly pile up some new library code while solving our own problems, then we are also helping our fellow programmers when they have similar problems to solve.
burden
weight to be borne or conveyed
...format_guard, which can automatically revert any format setting. Additionally, we add a wrapper type, which can contain any value, but when it is printed, it gets special formatting without burdening us with I/O manipulator noise: 1. First, we include some headers and declare that we use the std namespace: #include #include using namespace std; 2. The...
fan
a device for creating a current of air by movement
Fans of the bracket initialization style say that using brackets makes it very explicit, that the variable is initialized with a constructor call, and that this code line is not reinitializing anything.
inhabitant
a person who lives in a particular place
Let's use it to search for a German city with more than two million inhabitants in our small example set.
absence
the state of being not present
...or exceptions in general. If any system-related function has seen an error condition, it is able to set the errno variable to something other than 0 (0 describes the absence of errors), and then the caller is able to read that error number and look up what its value means. The only problem with this is that when we...
precede
be earlier in time
All code that precedes it is just set up work and all code that follows it is just for printing.
remind
put in the mind of someone
The operating system does, of course, remind itself of waking the thread up again.
observation
the act of taking a patient look
This is an important observation:
reward
compensation for worthy acts or retribution for wrongdoing
A look at the loop that uses num_range is, on the other hand, very rewarding because it looks so perfectly simple!
boil
change from a liquid to vapor
As size_type is an unsigned variable, this boils down to a very large number.
passion
a strong feeling or emotion
He has a strong passion for modern C++ implementations of lowlevel software, and he tries hard to combine high performance with an elegant coding style.
submit
yield to the control of another
To view the previously submitted errata, go to https://www.packtpub.com/books/conten t/supportand enter the name of the book in the search field.
mental
involving the mind or an intellectual process
We should get a mental picture of what needs to happen:
disappoint
fail to meet the hopes or expectations of
If we want to pass a string or a substring to a library that does not even support std::string, we can only provide a raw string pointer, which is a bit disappointing, because it sets us back to the old C days.
praise
an expression of approval and commendation
However, we are not here to praise Haskell but to improve our C++ skills.
principal
main or most important
Sean Parent, principal scientist at Adobe Systems at the time, popularized this algorithm because it is both useful and short.
vast
unusually great in size or amount or extent or scope
Because of the vastness of general numeric application scenarios (not only because of the Fourier transformation of course), the STL also tries to be useful in the context of numeric computation.
lean
incline or bend from a vertical position
This way, the programmer can lean back and express his intent, while the compiler can choose the optimal implementation for the given task.
practical
guided by experience and observation rather than theory
If an std::vector is perfect for our use case, it is still very simple and practical to add items to it in a sorting manner.
narrow
not wide
We are not going to change the string, but the view on the string by narrowing it down to the actual non-whitespace part of the string.
pity
a feeling of sympathy and sorrow for misfortunes of others
...file if we want to get an exception when opening that file is not possible: ifstream f {"non_existant.txt"}; f.exceptions(...); // too late for an exception This is a pity because exceptions actually promise that they make error handling less clumsy compared to old-school C-style code, which is riddled with loads of if branches, which handle errors after every...
accompany
go or travel along with
In that case, we must insert it, accompanied with a new counter being set to 1.
